Another helpful matric is the Sortino Ratio. Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but it only takes into account the variation in negative returns.\n",

Many modern brokers provide no fee or zero commission trading. Another thing to consider is taxes. If the trading is done in a retirement account, it probably won't matter. However, issues with long term and short term capital gains tax may come into play. The additional gains made from a strategy that gets in and out of an equity on a daily basis may be offset by the higher short term capital gains whereas a buy and hold might only face long term capital gains tax when sold.
